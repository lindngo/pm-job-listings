## Product Management (PM) Job Listings Analysis

# Overview
As I have been job searching for product positions, I was curious on how I could better optimize my resume to fit the keywords, phrases, and qualifications that companies are looking for. I began parsing through PM listings on LinkedIn to compile an Excel sheet of position names, job descriptions, and qualifications. With Python, I used pandas and sklearn to perform K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering to better understand what common similarities stretch across these listings.
